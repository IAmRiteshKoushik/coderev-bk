## Overview
![System Design](./screenshots/SystemDesign.png)

- The server accepts files from the frontend, zips and stores the zipped file in `AWS S3` repositories. 
- Meanwhile, it also inserts the corresponding records in the `user` and `project` collections of the database.
- Next, Code Review is initiated and the recommendations are fetched, and these details are inserted in the database.
- The frontend acceses all relevent details from the database via  routes in the backend server that handle them.
